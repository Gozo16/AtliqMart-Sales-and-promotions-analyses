Overview
This is an interactive dashboard for sales and promotions run by AtliqMart in different cities of India. The Campaigns include Diwali and Sankranti. This dashboard is useful in helping the sales team analyze the performances of different stores and cities.

Business Problem
AtliQ Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their AtliQ branded products. Now the sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period. 
Sales director Bruce Haryali wanted this immediately but the analytics manager Tony is engaged on another critical project. Tony decided to give this work to Peter Pandey who is the curious data analyst of AtliQ Mart. Since these insights will be directly reported to the sales director, Tony also provided some notes to Peter to support his work.

Objectives
Analyze the company's sales and promotions statistics in terms of its campaigns, cities, products, and categories and provide useful insights from those analyses that help businesses make informed decisions and improve future promotional campaigns.
